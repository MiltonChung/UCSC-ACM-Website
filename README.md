## About

This React + Sanity project utilizes NPM packages like React Router Dom and Node Sass for the frontend, and Sanity Studio for the Content Management System. Using Sanity allows members of the current ACM club to be able to edit/change the board member's descriptions and add upcoming events without ever touching code through Sanity Studio's content management system. I learned how to dynamically load the contents and display it on the website. This website will be open to public around Spring 2021.

Time to complete: ~ 30 hours
